      <h1>The Illusion of Free Will</h1>
      <p>02/13/2026</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>On November 24, 2009, a group of cavers went to explore the Nutty Putty Cave. Among the group was someone named John Edward Jones. He split apart from the main party to find the “Birth Canal,” an extremely narrow passageway that had a turnaround at the end. While trying to find it, Jones entered an unmapped passage near an area called “Ed’s Push,” which he thought was the Birth Canal. Jones crawled forward until he saw a narrow opening going straight down. Thinking that this was the turnaround in the Birth Canal, Jones entered head-first and became wedged upside-down. For 27 hours, Jones was stuck in this position with rescue attempts being unsuccessful. Ultimately, on November 25, 2009, Jones died from cardiac arrest because of the strain put on his body after many hours in this excruciating position.</p>
      <p>The Nutty Putty Cave incident brought caving into public attention. Along with this attention would come questions. One of the most prominent questions that appears when someone hears about a caving incident, such as the one mentioned, is “why?” Why would someone with a loving family and seemingly no problems want to risk their life going into a cave to see a bunch of rocks? Why would someone choose to do this? Well, what if they could not choose? What if every decision they have made has already been decided for them? That would be ridiculous, right? No, it is not ridiculous and even plausible that all of our decisions have already been made for us, that we do not have free will.</p>
      <p>What do we mean by “free will”? Well, of course, it means that you have the freedom to choose your actions; that is, an agent’s decisions are up to them. Well, what does it mean for someone’s actions to be “up to them”? It depends on who you ask. Traditionally, decisions are “up to them” if they had the option of not doing something they have done or if they were the ultimate source of your decision. There have been some other definitions of free will, such as the freedom for an agent to act upon their own motivation. I will prove that none of these views can allow free will to exist.</p>

      <h2>Free Will in the Sense of the Ability to Do Otherwise</h2>
      <p>For the first definition of free will, that an agent’s actions are free if the agent could have done otherwise, we can turn to Peter van Inwagen’s “The Incompatibility of Free Will and Determinism.” Van Inwagen defines determinism with a series of axioms. They are:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Determinism involves a notion of "the state of the entire world."</li>
	<li>A state must be describes such that nothing follows logically from it at other times. For example, a state cannot be described as "The world is in a state where Billy's left hand will be raised in 10 seconds."</li>
	<li>If there is a change in the way things are, there must also be a change in the state of the world.</li>
	<li>for every instant of time, there is aproposition that describes the state of the world at that time.</li>
	<li>If we were to apply the laws of physics to proposition A, we would get proposition B, which describes a state further in th efuture than the state A describes.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Van Inwagen then creates a scenario and uses these axioms to prove that determinism cannot be compatible with free will. In his situation, a judge, J, is presiding over a case and can raise his hand to pardon the defendant. The judge is not suffering from any illness that could impact his cognition or movement, is not under the influence of any substances that could affect his judgment, and does not have any incentive to act in one direction or another. Let us suppose that P is a proposition that describes the state of the world at T and that the judge will not raise his hand at T. Now, let’s set T<sub>0</sub> as a time before J was born, P<sub>0</sub> as a proposition that describes T<sub>0</sub>, and L as the laws of physics. With those variables defined, van Inwagen starts his argument.

      <ol>
	<li>If determinism is true, P<sub>0</sub> and L entail P.</li>
	<li>If J had raised his hand at T, P would be false.</li>
	<li>If the previous statement is true, J could render P false.</li>
	<li>If J could have rendered P, which is P<sub>0</sub> and L, false, J coudl have rendered P<sub>0</sub> and L false.</li>
	<li>Uf J could have rendered P<sub>0</sub> and L false, J could have rendered L false.</li>
	<li>But J could not have rendered L false.</li>
	<li>So J could not have raised his hand at T.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Using van Inwagen’s argument, we can synthesize another similar proof that if determinism is true, an agent cannot do otherwise, and therefore, free will cannot exist in this sense. If we use van Inwagen’s definition of determinism, we can see that if an agent is given the same conditions, we should expect to see the same result.</p>
      <p>My argument will involve the notion of a “clone,” which I will define as “a copy of the state of the world at time T defined by P, which denotes the proposition that describes the state of the world at time T.” I will call what is being cloned the clone’s “originator.” Similar to van Inwagen, I treat P as a “rigid designator" and assume that it describes the state of the world and any clones of that state at T with infinite precision. With these, we can form three axioms for clones:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>A clone will act in the same way as its originator.</li>
	<li>If a clone were to be overlaid on top of its originator, there would be no discernible difference between an object being overlaid with its clone and its originator alone.</li>
	<li>A clone is the same as its originator</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We can prove the first axiom using van Inwagen’s definition of determinism. If P<sub>0</sub> describes the state of the world at T<sub>0</sub>, and P describes the state of the world at T, by applying the laws of physics to P<sub>0</sub>, we should get P. Since P<sub>0</sub> accurately describes the state of the world at T<sub>0</sub> and any clones of it, we should expect both the clone and its originator to act in the same fashion when the laws of physics are applied to them. This also means that if a clone tries to act differently from its originator, the clone and its originator would have to perform both actions. If the clone and its originator cannot perform both actions, the clone will perform its originator’s action. The second axiom follows logically from the first. If both the clone and its originator act and look exactly the same, we would be unable to differentiate between them. Since there is no way to differentiate between a clone and its originator, we can say that they are the same, proving axiom three.</p>
      <p>Let us imagine a scenario where an agent A goes into a bakery at time T and will decide which piece of bread they will buy. Let us also define “P” as the denotation of the proposition that describes the state of the world at T. We will assume that the same things about the judge in van Inwagen’s example apply to our agent, that they are not physically or mentally inhibited and were under no pressure to act in one way or another. Suppose that A will buy a piece of sourdough, S.</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Let us make a clone of the state of the world at T, which includes A and S. All clones will have a subscript of "0".</li>
	<li>A will buy S.</li>
	<li>A = A<sub>0</sub> and S = S<sub>0</sub>.</li>
	<li>If free will exists in the sense that an agennt has the ability to do otherwise, A<sub>0</sub> has the ability to not buy S<sub>0</sub>.</li>
	<li>So, there must be a way for A to both buy and not buy S.</li>
	<li>But, there is not a way for A to both buy and not buy S.</li>
	<li>Therefore, A must buy S</li>
	<li>Free will in the sense that an agent has the bility to do otherwise cannot exist.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If anyone is skeptical of my argument, let us examine each point individually.</p>
      <ol>
	<li>This sets up the clone and the formatting to describe them.</li>
	<li>This is determined by the scenario.</li>
	<li>This is backed up by the third axiom for clones.</li>
	<li>Since the actions for A are determined by the scenario, the clone must be given the opportunity to do otherwise.</li>
	<li>Given the first axiom for clones, there must be a way for A to do this.</li>
	<li>It is not possible for one agent to both perform and not perform an action at the same time. For example, if we take the statement "Bob raises his hand and simultaneously does not raise his hand," we can see that bob can either raise his hand or not, not both. In this case, A can either buy S or not buy S, not both.</li>
	<li>We can form a list that expresses all possible combinations of actions A can perform. A can: buy S, or both buy and not buy S. Since A cannot both buy and not buy S, A can only buy S.</li>
	<li>This statement follows logically from the previous steps</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Free Will as Being the Ultimate Source of Action</h2>
      <p>Another popular definition of free will is that an agent is the ultimate originator of their actions. More specifically, the agent causes an event that leads to their action. To disprove this, we can look at Arthur Schopenhauer’s essay “On the Freedom of the Will.” In it, Schopenhauer, like van Inwagen, describes how the world must act if determinism is true. He says that “...when the earlier change, the cause, has occurred, the latter change thereby produced, the effect, must occur quite inevitably and consequently ensues necessarily." Schopenhauer further elaborates on the concept of causality by providing three types of changes. They are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
	<li>Cause - Events that occur between two nonliving things. We can analyze these with Newtonian physics.</li>
	<li>Stimulus - Events that occur through physical contact between a nonliving thing and a plant.</li>
	<li>Motivation - Events that occur because of an animal’s cognition.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>As we go from cause to stimulus to motivation, we can see that the number of steps between the cause and effect increases, but the same causes will result in the same effect. What this means is that we can explain both stimuli and motivation as a series of causes. Schopenhauer sets up two scenarios to explain how this works in the context of free will: In the first one, a man is done with his shift at work. He can go for a walk, go to the club, go to the theater, climb a tower, visit a friend, or run out the city gates and never come back again, but he goes home to his wife. In the second scenario, some water is in a pond. It can form high waves, rush down a hill, foam and splash, rise as a jet into the air, or boil away, but it stays calm in the pond. In the second scenario, the water cannot do any of those things except stay calm in the pond because the other options require a cause that doesn’t occur: To form high waves, there must be some kind of storm. To foam and splash, there must be a waterfall. To boil away, there must be a strong heat source. In the same fashion, we can say that the man in the first scenario cannot do anything except go home to his wife because the required causes for the other options have not occurred.</p>
      <p>According to Schopenhauer, the cause for someone to perform or not perform an action is a strong enough motive and their character. He states that a motive “...could never act like a physical obstacle, since the latter might easily exceed absolutely the physical forces of a human being, whereas a motive can never be irresistible in itself or have absolute power but it may still always be overcome by a stronger countermotive…” This means that if an agent does something, it is because the motive for that action is what they feel is the strongest. But in order to determine the strongest motive, an agent must have a set of fundamental values they can judge motives off of. This is when someone’s character comes into play.</p>
      <p>When an agent looks into their self-consciousness, they find that they feel like they have the ability to do anything as long as they are not stopped. However, this is only the freedom to do something without any physical obstructions. Let us say that an agent has a will to buy a piece of sourdough, so they go to the bakery and buy a piece of sourdough. They had a will, and they acted on it. Surely this qualifies as free will, right? Not really, the agent acted on their will, but their will was given a set of motives and it reacted to which one it thought was the strongest. Schopenhauer describes an agent’s character as something that controls their will’s reaction to a set of motives; it has four attributes.</p>

      <ol>
	<li>It is individual; a person’s character is different from everyone else’s. We cannot predict what a person will do given a motive. For example, if an agent were given the motive of wanting something that tastes good, we cannot predict what they will do. They might get a loaf of sourdough, a cheesecake, or nothing at all.</li>
	<li>It is empirical; a person’s character can only be discovered through experience. For instance, an agent can speculate if they will enjoy a loaf of sourdough, but only after trying will they be absolutely sure if they enjoy it or not.</li>
	<li>It is constant; a person’s character will not change. This may seem absurd, as an agent may have disliked sourdough as a child, but now enjoys it as an adult, but this change is only superficial. Suppose that the agent is extremely cautious about trying new tastes. The motive of trying sourdough may have been strong enough for them to act on it, which resulted in the agent realizing that they enjoy sourdough. Nothing about their character has changed, only how it is expressed.</li>
	<li>It is inborn; a person’s character is determined by nature, not nurture. For example, two people can be raised in very similar environments but will exhibit different characters.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Given these attributes of character, we can see that, given the same circumstances, an agent will perform the same action. Since it is inborn, and an agent cannot control the circumstances of their birth, an agent cannot control their character. Since an agent’s character controls their will’s reaction to a motive, and their will controls their action, an agent is not the ultimate source of their action, disproving the existence of free will in the sense of an agent being the ultimate source of their action.</p>
      <p>Suppose that there is someone who disagrees with Schopenhauer and believes that an agent will freely choose between a set of motives. We can also form another proof using some basic logic and Newtonian physics. Let us start by saying that the agent must be the ultimate source of their decision to choose what they believe to be the strongest motive. To be the ultimate source, the agent must be able to control an effect that can result in their action. There are three problems with this.</p>

      <ol>
	<li>How can an agent produce an effect without there being a cause for it? According to Newton’s first law of motion, an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted upon by a force, and an object in motion will stay in constant linear motion unless acted upon by a force. The force is the effect that an agent must produce, and the change in an object’s motion would be what happens because of that effect. Since we have seen earlier that motivation can be explained through causes, we can deduce that if an agent can produce an effect, that effect can result in their motivation and action. If an agent were to make an effect that did not have a cause, they would be breaking one of the fundamental laws of physics.</li>
	<li>Suppose that an agent is able to produce an effect without any cause. How can they control this cause? When we look at an agent’s action, we can find the cause of it, the cause of the cause, and so on. For example, let’s say an agent bought a loaf of sourdough. We can say that they bought it because their brain told them to. Their brain told them to because a specific series of neurons fired. Those neurons fired because of a complex electrical mechanism. We can keep going down this chain of causes until we reach either the beginning of the universe or until we enter the realm of quantum mechanics. The agent did not exist during the beginning of the universe, and quantum mechanics, as we currently understand it, is driven by random probabilities. An agent cannot control what happened during the beginning of the universe because they did not exist and could not do anything, regardless of if they had free will or not. Similarly, an agent cannot control randomness because the nature of something random is that it is not determined by anything.</li>
	<li>Suppose that it is possible for an agent to make an effect with no cause, and that they are able to control it. How would they know that this cause would result in their action? Take chaos theory: a small change in initial conditions can cause a wildly different result. If an agent were to be able to make an effect, they would have to be able to predict everything that would happen afterwards to ensure that they get the action they want. Furthermore, suppose we are able to do this; we do not go around trying to deduce what effect we should produce in order to get our desired action. But what if we do not do this because this is just an unconscious activity? That still does not prove anything; you cannot control an unconscious activity. Take your heart, for instance. Can you make your heart stop beating? No, because it is an unconscious activity, and you are not in control of unconscious activity.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>With these issues, we can see that not only is it not possible for an agent to be the source of their action, but it is also not possible for them to control that source, and it is implausible that they can produce their desired action.</p>

      <h2>Free Will as Acting Upoin One's Motivation</h2>
      <p>One of the most popular definitions of free will is the freedom of an agent to act upon their own motivation. When asking someone who believes in free will to prove their belief, they will usually say something along the lines of “I can do whatever I want” and start to perform Chen 12 some arbitrary action (like breakdancing) to show this. What these people mean is that an agent has free will if they perform an action and they are not:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Coerced: An agent does not have free will if someone is threatening them to act in a certain way.</li>
	<li>Manipulated: An agent does not have free will if someone or something is changing their way of thinking. This is slightly different from coercion because manipulation does not put psychological stress on the agent, and it also includes things like alcohol consumption.</li>
	<li>Addicted: An agent does not have free will if they have an uncontrollable compulsion for something. For example, if an agent is addicted to alcohol, they will naturally want to have more alcohol even if they do not want to continue drinking.</li>
	<li>Mentally ill: An agent does not have free will if they have some form of mental illness</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This definition can be dismantled through Schopenhauer’s argument. Even though an agent can do as they will, they cannot will what they will, so their actions are not free. This led other people to try to strengthen this stance on free will. One of them was Harry G. Frankfurt.</p>

      <p>In his essay “Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person,” Frankfurt starts by defining what he calls first and second-order desires. He calls first-order desires “...statements of the form ‘A wants to X’ … in which the term ‘to X’ refers to an action” and second-order desires “...statements of the form ‘A wants to X’ … in which the term ‘to X’ refers to a desire of the first order”. He then splits his idea of a second-order desire into two categories: One in which an agent wants to have the feeling of wanting something, and one in which an agent wants the first-order desire to be their will. He calls the second category a “second-order volition”. For example, if an agent wants the feeling of wanting to eat sourdough, but does not want to eat it, that is a second-order desire, but if an agent wants to want to eat sourdough, that is a second-order volition. Frankfurt argues that free will simply involves an agent’s will being aligned with their second-order volition. To illustrate this, he uses an example of two drug addicts. The first has a second-order volition to want to not use drugs, but their will is such that they will want to use drugs. Therefore, this first drug addict is not acting freely. The second addict has a second-order volition to want to use drugs, and their will is aligned with this, so they are acting freely</p>
      <p>One of the major problems with Frankfurt’s idea is in the second-order volition. How can we be sure that an agent’s will can agree with their second-order volition? Let’s start by stating some ideas:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Desires and volitions of any level are all “wants.” They are made in the format of “A wants to X,” so they are “wants.”</li>
	<li>Wants are actions. An action can be described using a verb. Since “want” is a verb, it is an action.</li>
	<li>The will is a part of cognition. Humans have a will because they have a brain, whereas nonliving things do not have a will because they do not have a brain.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Since a second-order volition is a want, and a want is an action, an agent’s will and second-order volition for that want must be aligned with that want. This would make the statement “A wants to want to want to do X,” which is a “third-order desire”. A clear problem arises: we can set up a fourth-order desire, and we can do this infinitely. Therefore, if an agent has free will in Frankfurt’s sense, their will must agree with infinitely many of these higher-order desires. Since the will is part of cognition, and cognition involves the brain, there must be infinitely many distinct events that occur in the brain. However, completing an infinite series in a finite amount of time is not possible because the definition of infinity requires it to be never-ending. This impossibility means that free will in Frankfurt’s sense does not exist.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The existence of free will is a topic that has been widely debated since before recorded human history to the modern era and by people from all over the world. Over time, there have been several attempts to accurately define what “free will” means, but as we have seen throughout this paper, many of these definitions do not guarantee its existence. I do not deny that we feel like we have free will. But, as the title of this paper suggests, that feeling is just an illusion. In reality, we do not have free will.</p>
